# Product Inventory Manager

This project is a **tutorial-based** application where I explore and integrate multiple technologies such as **Vue.js**, **TypeScript**, **Prisma**, **AWS Lambda**, and **CockroachDB**. This is my attempt at using these technologies together to grasp their concepts and functionalities. The goal is to learn how to build a modern full-stack application with the following components:

- **Vue.js** (Frontend framework)
- **TypeScript** (Strongly typed JavaScript)
- **Prisma** (ORM for database management)
- **AWS Lambda** (Serverless compute service)
- **CockroachDB** (Distributed SQL database)

## Features

- **Frontend**: A simple Vue.js app with TypeScript, showcasing basic CRUD operations for managing products.
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda functions with Prisma for interacting with a CockroachDB database.
- **Database**: CockroachDB used for handling product data with scalability and fault tolerance.
  
This project serves as a hands-on tutorial to explore these technologies and how they can work together to build a modern, scalable web application.

## Usage
- **Create a Product**: Use the form to add a new product with details like name, description, price, and stock quantity.
- **Update a Product**: Edit any existing product's details.
- **Delete a Product**: Remove a product from the list by clicking the delete button.
- **View Products**: All products are listed in a table with their details.
